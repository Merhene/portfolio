> ###### Through my first experience as a developer in a high-pressure and complex development environment, I quickly realized the value of the stress management and interpersonal skills I acquired during my military service. 
I wasn't afraid to approach others, ask what might seem like "silly questions" (even though no question should be regarded as such), or offer support to my colleagues with <b>"coffee break ??"</b> . My proactive approach helped me take ownership of tasks, strictly follow procedures, and contribute to critical processes such as estimations and task tracking. These experiences solidified my ability to thrive in challenging contexts and collaborate effectively within a team, all while maintaining focus on the objectives and delivering high-quality results.

The "Mouvement Collaborateur" project was developed for Groupama to streamline human resources management, focusing on employee movements within the company. The objective was to create a scalable and dynamic web application that allows for easy management of employee transfers, onboarding, and other HR-related tasks.

This project was developed using Agile Scrum methodology to ensure iterative development, with regular feedback from stakeholders, and to adapt to evolving requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

### Technologies Used
##### Front-End: 
The dynamic user interface was built using <b>Blade</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>Alpine.js</b>, providing a responsive and interactive experience for users.

##### Back-End: 
The core functionality was developed using <b>PHP</b> with the <b>Laravel</b> framework, ensuring a robust and scalable back-end architecture to manage HR processes efficiently.

##### Deployment and Scalability: 
<b>Docker</b> was integrated to ensure flexible and efficient deployment, enabling the application to scale easily as the company’s needs grow.

##### Testing: 
The project was rigorously tested using <b>PestPHP</b>, ensuring high code reliability and quality.

##### Documentation: 
Detailed <b>technical documentation</b> was created to facilitate the future maintenance of the application, ensuring clarity for the development team.

### Key Features
##### Employee Movement Management:
The application allowed HR staff to track and manage the movements of employees, including onboarding, transfers, and exits, ensuring smooth transitions within the company.

##### Responsive Interface:
Using Blade for templating, along with JavaScript and Alpine.js, the front-end was designed to be dynamic and easy to use, allowing HR personnel to access and update information effortlessly.

##### Sprints: 
Development was divided into short sprints, allowing for the weekly-delivery of functional increments.
##### Daily Stand-ups: 
Regular meetings were held to track progress and address any blockers.
##### Feedback Loops: 
Feedback from stakeholders, including HR managers and users, was gathered and integrated after each sprint, ensuring that the application met the company’s needs.
