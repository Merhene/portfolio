As part of the <b style="color: red; background-color: white;">CGI</b> Center of Excellence in Lyon (C.O.E), I am involved in helping clients transform their supply chains and ecosystems through the application of advanced digital technologies. The center's mission is to collaborate closely with global clients to assess their specific needs and develop innovative digital solutions for supply chain management. We also explore new partnership models that promote collaboration and innovation across industries.

The Supply Chain Showroom at the center features several interactive stations, each representing a different stage of the innovation process, providing clients with a hands-on experience of the transformation journey.

### Currently developing an application for the C.O.E using Node.js, React, Docker, and PostgreSQL.
> ##### This project involves building a dynamic interface tailored to client needs within the supply chain domain. Although still in progress and confidential, it leverages modern web technologies to deliver scalable and efficient solutions.
